# Dom-s_Pizza_Sales_Project

The raw data for this project is presented in 4 CSV files.
This data represents a yearâ€™s worth of sales for a pizza outlet, and they need to answer a few questions which will help them make important decisions to increase sales and improve their business.

The project is done in MySQL Workbench. The data was loaded into 4 tables.
This project involves the use of simple joins and sub-queries.
# Database Creation:
I established a database named "Dom's Pizza" and defined two key tables: "orders" to track order details like order ID, date, and time, and "order_details" to capture specific pizza orders within each transaction.

# Basic Analysis:
I retrieved essential metrics such as the total number of orders placed, calculated total revenue generated, identified top-priced pizzas, determined popular pizza sizes, and analyzed pizza category distribution.
# Intermediate Analysis:
Leveraging SQL joins and grouping functions, I delved deeper into sales patterns, including total pizza quantities ordered by category, distribution of orders by hour, top-selling pizza types with quantities, and average daily pizza orders.
# Advanced Analysis:
I conducted advanced analyses like calculating revenue contributions by pizza type, analyzing cumulative revenue over time, and identifying top revenue-generating pizzas within each category, providing actionable insights for business growth.
